h1. Scramble Tweet

Research says that words can still be read if the letters scrambled, as long as the first and the last letter stay still.
So I make a twitter client in order to try this.

It's based on dabr engine, no need to much config.

h2. Getting Started

It has been designed to work on Apache,
with PHP 5.2+ (because it uses the json_decode() function).
I my self running a test server on a Windows OS (poor me :P ) is XAMPP (or XAMPP Lite)
You need to copy all the files onto the server for it to work.
No database is needed.


h3. A 'Lil Configure 

Rename config.sample.php to config.php
Change ENCRYPTION_KEY in config.php to a random string of gibberish, maximum 52 characters.
Fill the OAUTH_CONSUMER_KEY and OAUTH_CONSUMER_SECRET
Voila! Everythings done!
